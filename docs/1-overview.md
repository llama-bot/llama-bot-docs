# Overview

:::warning
**The Llama Bot is under heavy development.**<br />
It can not even be called unstable. Most of the features are not written yet.
:::

The Llama bot is a [discord](https://discord.com) bot made for the [LP community discord server](https://discord.gg/2fsar34APa).<br />
It has a web GUI frontend for quick and easy usage, and it also has an HTTP API for more complex apps to be built on top of it.

## FAQ

### Can I use this bot in my discord server?

You can not invite this bot to your server, unfortunately.<br />
However, since the source code is available on [github](https://github.com/llama-bot), you **can** set up the bot yourself though it requires quite a bit of technical knowledge.

You need to be familiar with the following to be more specific:

- [git](https://git-scm.com) (and [github](https://github.com))
- [linux servers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix)
- [discord bots](https://discord.com/developers/docs)

If you think you are ready to setup the bot yourself, head over to the following pages:

- [Setting up the Llama bot](/docs/bot/setting-up)
- [Setting up the web interface](/docs/web-interface/setting-up)

### I want to contribute! Where do I start?

If you are a developer and want to contribute to the project, the [contribution guide](https://github.com/llama-bot/llama-bot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) should be a good place to start.
